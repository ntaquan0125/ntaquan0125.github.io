I am a Ph.D. student in a CIFRE fellowship program between Huawei Paris Research Center, University Gustave Eiffel and the French National Institute for Geographic and Forest Information.
I received my master's degree from University Sorbonne Paris Nord, France and bachelorâ€™s degree from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Vietnam.
My research interests lie primarily in the areas of 3D scene understanding.
